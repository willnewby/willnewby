### Hi there 👋

I'm Will (they/them). I'm an SRE/Ops human, a manager of teams @ small organizations (>200 people), a parent and devotee of good soundsystems and bigger monitors. I listen to a lot of lofi. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Deno's Edge Hosting Platform and leading Deno's SRE practice.
- 🌱 I’m learning Thanos and PromQL in excruciating detail plus Rust, Typescript, and a whole pile of GCP quirks at work
- 😄 Pronouns: they/them (I'm trans and non-binary 🏳️‍)
- 🧏 Fun fact: I'm learning ASL with my kid
