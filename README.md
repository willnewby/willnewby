### Hi there 👋

I'm Will. I'm an SRE/Ops human, a manager of teams @ small organizations (>200 people), a parent and devotee of good soundsystems and bigger monitors. I listen to a lot of lofi. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Deno's Edge Hosting Platform (I'm hiring! I'm looking for Deno's [next SRE](https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/Deno))
- 🌱 I’m learning Thanos, PromQL in excruciating detail, Rust, Typescript, and a whole pile of GCP quirks at work
- 😄 Pronouns: they/them, he/him, and she/her (I'm trans and non-binary 🏳️‍)
- 🧏 Fun fact: I'm learning ASL with my kid
